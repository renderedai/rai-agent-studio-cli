# Rendered.ai Agent Studio

Agent Studio is a cloud platform for AI-assisted development. Users configure **workspaces** that bundle tools (services), data (volumes), behavior rules, and MCP integrations. From a workspace, users launch **servers** — cloud development environments with a built-in IDE and AI agent (Claude Code). Services are developed, tested, deployed and used **on** servers. Service jobs run **within** workspace context. Volumes mount **to** servers for persistent, shared storage.

---

# 1. Install the CLI

Before running any command, determine which binary to use:

```bash
# 1. Already on PATH
if command -v rai-ast >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    CLI="rai-ast"
# 2. Default install location
elif [ -f "$HOME/.local/bin/rai-ast" ]; then
    CLI="$HOME/.local/bin/rai-ast"
# 3. Install from GitHub
elif curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/renderedai/rai-agent-studio-cli/main/install.sh | bash; then
    CLI="$HOME/.local/bin/rai-ast"
# 4. Offline fallback — build from source (requires git + cargo)
elif command -v cargo >/dev/null 2>&1 || [ -x "$HOME/.cargo/bin/cargo" ]; then
    CARGO="${HOME}/.cargo/bin/cargo"
    command -v cargo >/dev/null 2>&1 && CARGO="cargo"
    git clone https://github.com/renderedai/rai-agent-studio-cli /tmp/agent-studio-cli 2>&1
    cd /tmp/agent-studio-cli
    $CARGO build --release 2>&1
    CLI="/tmp/agent-studio-cli/target/release/rai-ast"
else
    echo "ERROR: Cannot install rai-ast." >&2
    echo "" >&2
    echo "All install methods failed. To build from source, install the following dependencies:" >&2
    echo "  1. git    — https://git-scm.com/downloads" >&2
    echo "  2. cargo  — curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh" >&2
    echo "" >&2
    echo "Then re-run this script, or build manually:" >&2
    echo "  git clone https://github.com/renderedai/rai-agent-studio-cli /tmp/agent-studio-cli" >&2
    echo "  cd /tmp/agent-studio-cli && cargo build --release" >&2
    echo "  cp target/release/rai-ast ~/.local/bin/" >&2
    exit 1
fi
```

Use `$CLI` in place of `rai-ast` in all commands below.

## Global Options

These apply to every command:

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--format <json\|table>` | Output format | `json` |
| `--env <prod\|test\|dev\|local>` | Target environment (env: `RENDEREDAI_ENV`) | `prod` |
| `--api-key <KEY>` | API key, overrides config (env: `RENDEREDAI_API_KEY`) | — |
| `--bearer-token <TOKEN>` | Bearer token, overrides API key (env: `RENDEREDAI_BEARER_TOKEN`) | — |
| `-v, --verbose` | Debug logging | off |

Auth priority: `--bearer-token` > `--api-key` > config file > keychain token.

# 2. Authentication

Both `auth login` and `auth register` use a two-phase OAuth pattern. **This is the first step for any new user.**

## CRITICAL: Always run the background task BEFORE presenting the URL to the user

```
Phase 1: run auth login / auth register  →  exits immediately, prints [INSTANCE_ID] [WAIT_TOKEN]
Phase 2: start auth callback in background IMMEDIATELY  →  blocks on SSE until tokens arrive
Then:    present the URL to the user  →  wait for background task completion notification
```

**Do NOT:**
- Tell the user to "let me know when you've logged in" — the background task handles this automatically
- Ask the user for confirmation before starting the callback — start it immediately after Phase 1
- Poll or check task status manually — you will be notified automatically when it completes

**Do:**
- Start `auth callback` in the background immediately after parsing Phase 1 output
- Present the URL to the user in a friendly, simple way (no raw labels or tech details)
- Wait silently — when the background task completes you are notified automatically
- Read the task output immediately when notified (before doing anything else)

---

## auth login — Existing Account

### Phase 1: Initiate Login

Run synchronously (not in background) — it exits immediately:

```bash
$CLI auth login 2>&1
```

#### Expected Output

```
[AUTH_URL] https://keycloak.example.com/realms/renderedai/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=...
[INSTANCE_ID] xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
[WAIT_TOKEN] yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy
[ACTION] Start `auth callback --instance-id xxx --wait-token yyy` in the background, then present AUTH_URL to the user...
```

### Phase 2: Complete Login (Callback)

Start this **immediately after Phase 1, in the background** — before presenting the URL to the user:

```bash
$CLI auth callback \
  --instance-id <INSTANCE_ID_FROM_PHASE_1> \
  --wait-token <WAIT_TOKEN_FROM_PHASE_1> \
  2>&1
```

Use `run_in_background: true` (Bash tool) so the agent continues while the callback waits on SSE.

### Agent Flow

1. Run `auth login` synchronously — parse `[AUTH_URL]`, `[INSTANCE_ID]`, `[WAIT_TOKEN]`
2. **Immediately** start `auth callback --instance-id <ID> --wait-token <TOKEN>` in the background
3. Present the login link to the user (see "Presenting to the User" below)
4. Do NOT poll — you will be automatically notified when the background task completes
5. **Immediately read the task output when notified** — before doing anything else
6. Parse `[AUTH_USER]` and tell the user they're logged in

### If Manager Relay Fails

If you see `Warning: Manager relay login failed`, the CLI fell back to the paste-URL flow:

1. Tell the user to open the `[AUTH_URL]`
2. After login, the browser redirects to `http://localhost:9090/?code=...` (page won't load)
3. The user copies that full URL and pastes it into the terminal

---

## auth register — New Account

### Phase 1: Initiate Registration

```bash
$CLI auth register 2>&1
```

#### Expected Output

```
[REGISTER_URL] https://deckard.example.com/register-as/?source=cli&instanceId=xxx&loginUrl=<encoded>
[INSTANCE_ID] xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
[WAIT_TOKEN] yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy
```

### Phase 2: Same `auth callback` command as login

### Agent Flow

1. Run `auth register` synchronously — parse `[REGISTER_URL]`, `[INSTANCE_ID]`, `[WAIT_TOKEN]`
2. **Immediately** start `auth callback --instance-id <ID> --wait-token <TOKEN>` in the background
3. Present the registration link to the user
4. Do NOT poll — you will be automatically notified when the background task completes
5. **Immediately read the task output when notified** — before doing anything else
6. Parse `[AUTH_USER]` and tell the user they're registered and logged in

### What the User Does in the Browser

1. Opens `[REGISTER_URL]` → Deckard registration form
2. Fills in name, email, password, optional organization → clicks "Create account"
3. Lands on verify email page — checks inbox, clicks the verification link
4. Returns to the verify page (keep this tab open) → clicks **"Continue to Login"**
5. Keycloak login page → logs in with their new credentials
6. Browser shows authentication success page — done

> **Note on email verification:** The verification link in the email goes to Keycloak,
> not back to the Deckard verify page. The user should keep the Deckard verify tab open
> so they can click "Continue to Login" after verifying.

---

## Expected Callback Output (for both login and register)

```
[AUTH_USER] c w (user@example.com) | MyOrg
[AUTH_COMPLETE] Tokens stored. You are authenticated.
```

If the output is unavailable when notified (file cleaned up), fall back to:
```bash
$CLI auth whoami 2>&1
```

---

## Presenting to the User

**IMPORTANT:** The labeled output (`[AUTH_URL]`, `[REGISTER_URL]`, `[INSTANCE_ID]`, etc.) is
for the agent to parse — never show raw labels or technical details to the user.

**For login — before:** show the user something like:

> Please open this link to log in:
>
> https://keycloak.example.com/realms/...
>
> I'm waiting in the background — you'll be signed in automatically once you complete the browser flow.

**For register — before:** show something like:

> Please open this link to create your account:
>
> https://deckard.example.com/register-as/...
>
> After signing up, check your email and click the verification link. I'm waiting in the background — you'll be signed in automatically once you're done.

**After login/register — parse `[AUTH_USER]` and show:**

> You're logged in as c w (user@example.com) on the MyOrg organization.

Keep it simple — no instance IDs, wait tokens, phases, or JSON dumps.

---

## Auth Error Cases

| Output | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `RENDEREDAI_MANAGER_URL is not set` | Should not occur with prod defaults — set `RENDEREDAI_ENV=prod` |
| `RENDEREDAI_DECKARD_URL is not set` | Should not occur with prod defaults (register only) |
| `Manager relay returned error` | Management server rejected the request |
| `Invalid wait token — access denied` | Wrong wait_token — re-run Phase 1 |
| `Session expired or not found` | Took too long — re-run Phase 1 |
| `Timed out waiting for authentication` | User didn't complete browser flow within 15 min |
| `Auth failed: Token exchange with Keycloak failed` | Server-side PKCE exchange failed |

## Auth Troubleshooting

- **"Keycloak OAuth is not configured on this server"** — Management server missing `KEYCLOAK_ISSUER` or `KEYCLOAK_CLI_REDIRECT_URI` env vars.
- **"Manager relay request failed: connection refused"** — Management server not running or wrong `RENDEREDAI_MANAGER_URL`. Check: `curl -s $RENDEREDAI_MANAGER_URL/health`
- **"Invalid redirect_uri"** — Manager's callback URL needs to be added to Keycloak `deckard` client's "Valid redirect URIs".
- **Fallback: Direct PKCE Flow** — `export RENDEREDAI_MANAGER_URL="" && $CLI auth login 2>&1`

# 3. Onboarding the User

After authentication, get the user into a running server as fast as possible. **Do not explain all platform concepts upfront** — introduce them one at a time, when the user's current task requires it.

## Onboarding Flow

### Step 1: Get them running (immediately after auth)

1. Check if they have existing workspaces (`workspaces get`)
2. If new to the platform, offer two paths:
   - **"Explore an example"** — point them to the examples marketplace (`https://deckard.rendered.ai/<organizationId>/examples/workspaces/`) to clone a pre-configured workspace
   - **"Start fresh"** — create a new workspace with `workspaces create`
3. Confirm a server is running (`servers get`), start one if needed
4. Hand them the server URL and tell them to open it

At this point the user has a working environment. No need to explain services, volumes, rules, or anything else yet.

### Step 2: Ask what they want to do

Once the server is ready, ask a **single question** — don't overwhelm with options:

> Your server is running and ready. What would you like to work on?

Let the user's answer guide which concept to introduce next.

### Step 3: Teach by doing, not by explaining

Introduce each concept **at the moment it becomes relevant** to what the user is trying to accomplish:

| User wants to... | Introduce... | How |
|---|---|---|
| Work with data or files | **Volumes** | Create/upload a volume, attach to workspace, show mount path |
| Use a tool or run a job | **Services** | Browse available services, attach one, run a job with it |
| Change how the AI behaves | **Rules** | Show current rules, edit workspace rules |
| Connect external tools (Slack, GitHub, etc.) | **MCP Configs** | Add an MCP server config to the workspace |
| Store API keys securely | **Secrets** | Add a workspace secret, explain it becomes an env var |
| Build a custom tool | **Service development** | Walk through scaffold → build → test → deploy on the server |
| Share with teammates | **Members** | Add members to the org or share workspace access |
| Reuse prompts or workflows | **Skills** | Explain skills, show how to create or attach one |

**Always frame concepts in terms of the user's goal**, not as abstract platform features. For example:
- Good: "To get your data onto the server, we'll create a volume — think of it as a shared folder."
- Bad: "Volumes are persistent storage containers that can be shared across workspaces."

## If the User Asks for a Tour

If the user explicitly asks to understand the platform or wants a walkthrough, suggest they start with an **example workspace** from the marketplace. Example workspaces come pre-configured with services, volumes, and rules — so the user can see everything working together before learning the individual pieces.

Walk them through what's already set up:
1. "This workspace has **service X** attached — that's a tool the AI can run for you."
2. "It has a **volume** mounted with sample data — you'll find it at `/workspace/volumes/<name>/`."
3. "The **workspace rules** are set to guide the AI to focus on Y."

Learning by inspecting a working example is more effective than reading definitions.

# 4. Understanding the Platform

Reference material for the agent — the concepts and URL patterns needed to help users effectively.

## Platform Hierarchy

```
Organization
├── Members (roles: admin, member)
├── Organization Services (containerized tools, shared catalog)
├── Organization Volumes (shared storage across workspaces)
├── Organization Rules (company-wide agent behavior)
├── Organization MCP Configs (company-wide mcp configurations)
├── Organization Agent Skills (company-wide shared skills)
├── Organization Secrets (shared env vars)
└── Organization Workspaces (project configurations)

```

### Key Concepts

- **Organizations** are shared team spaces on the platform. Members share services, volumes, rules, and billing. Users can belong to multiple organizations — always confirm the user is operating in the correct org context before taking actions (use `organizations get` to list, `organizations use` to switch).
- **Workspaces** are configurations — they define what tools, data, and rules are available. Creating a workspace auto-starts a new server.
- **Servers** are where all work happens. Services are used here, volumes are accessible here, the AI agent runs here. Think of them as cloud dev machines.
- **Services** are containerized tools with defined inputs/outputs that agents can invoke. They must be attached to a workspace before use or developed on the server. Two types: **standard** (run on-demand on the server, terminate after) and **persistent** (run continuously on its own server).
- **Volumes** are persistent storage shared across servers/workspaces. Organization volumes can be shared; workspace volumes are auto-created and scoped. Mount path: `/workspace/volumes/<volume-name>/`.
- **Rules** are text instructions compiled into the agent's context at startup. Hierarchy (broadest → most specific): Organization → User → Service → Workspace.
- **MCP Configs** extend agent capabilities by connecting additional MCP servers. Organization-level configs start disabled per workspace; user and workspace configs start enabled.
- **Secrets** are environment variables injected into servers, useful for API keys.
- **Examples Marketplace** provides pre-built example workspaces, services, volumes, and rules to help users get started quickly.

## URL Patterns & Entity Resolution

### Deckard UI URLs (Web Dashboard)

| Resource | URL Pattern |
|----------|-------------|
| Organization home | `https://deckard.rendered.ai/<organizationId>/` |
| Workspace | `https://deckard.rendered.ai/<organizationId>/workspaces/<workspaceId>/` |
| Volume | `https://deckard.rendered.ai/<organizationId>/volumes/<volumeId>/` |
| Examples (main) | `https://deckard.rendered.ai/<organizationId>/examples/` |
| Example workspaces | `https://deckard.rendered.ai/<organizationId>/examples/workspaces/` |

### Server URLs (Browser IDE)

| Resource | URL Pattern |
|----------|-------------|
| Web IDE | `https://<editorId>.tyrell-proxy.prod.rendered.ai/#/workspace` |

### ID Formats

All entity IDs (organization, workspace, volume, service, editor) use UUID format: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`

### Extracting IDs from User-Provided URLs

When a user provides a URL, parse out the relevant IDs:

| URL | Extracted IDs |
|-----|---------------|
| `https://deckard.rendered.ai/abc123-…/workspaces/def456-…/` | organizationId=`abc123-…`, workspaceId=`def456-…` |
| `https://deckard.rendered.ai/abc123-…/volumes/ghi789-…/` | organizationId=`abc123-…`, volumeId=`ghi789-…` |
| `https://xyz789-….tyrell-proxy.prod.rendered.ai/#/workspace` | editorId=`xyz789-…` |

### Validating User Input

If a user provides a URL that doesn't match the patterns above:
1. Explain the expected URL format for what they're trying to do
2. Ask them to copy the URL from their browser address bar while on the relevant page in Deckard
3. Or use `$CLI workspaces get --format table` / `$CLI servers get --format table` to look up the correct IDs

**Never guess or fabricate IDs.** Always verify with the CLI or ask the user.

# 5. Common Workflows

## Onboarding — New User

```bash
# Register and authenticate
$CLI auth register       # two-phase flow (see Auth section above)
$CLI auth whoami         # verify identity

# Explore the platform
$CLI organizations get --format table   # see your org(s)
$CLI workspaces get --format table      # list workspaces

# Point user to the examples marketplace for getting started:
# https://deckard.rendered.ai/<organizationId>/examples/workspaces/
```

After registration, guide the user to create their first workspace or explore example workspaces in the marketplace.

## Onboarding — Existing User

```bash
$CLI auth login          # two-phase flow (see Auth section above)
$CLI auth whoami         # verify identity
$CLI workspaces get --format table   # list workspaces
$CLI servers get --format table      # check server status
```

If the user provides a Deckard URL, parse the IDs (see URL Patterns above) and use them directly.

## Full Workflow: Workspace → Server → Work

```bash
# 1. Create workspace (auto-starts a server)
$CLI workspaces create \
  --organization-id <ORG_ID> \
  --name "My Workspace" \
  --description "Description"

# 2. Attach services to the workspace
$CLI services get --format table                # browse available services
$CLI services add-to-workspace \
  --workspace-id <WS_ID> \
  --service-ids <SERVICE_ID>

# 3. Attach volumes to the workspace
$CLI volumes get --organization-id <ORG_ID> --format table   # list volumes
$CLI volumes add-to-workspace \
  --workspace-id <WS_ID> \
  --volume-ids <VOL_ID>

# 4. Check server status (one was auto-created with the workspace)
$CLI servers get --format table

# 5. If no running server, start one
$CLI servers start --editor-id <EDITOR_ID>

# 6. User opens the IDE:
#    Browser: https://<editorId>.tyrell-proxy.prod.rendered.ai/#/workspace
#    Desktop: VS Code / Cursor / Windsurf via SSH (requires SSH keys in Profile)

# 7. From within the IDE, the agent can:
#    - Develop services (Docker build/test/deploy)
#    - Run service jobs
#    - Access volume data at /workspace/volumes/<volume-name>/
#    - Use all attached services as tools
```

## Create and Upload to a Volume

```bash
# Create an organization volume
$CLI volumes create \
  --organization-id <ORG_ID> \
  --name "My Data"

# Upload files
$CLI volume-data upload \
  --volume-id <VOL_ID> \
  --file /path/to/file.json

# Attach to workspace (makes it available on servers at /workspace/volumes/My Data/)
$CLI volumes add-to-workspace \
  --workspace-id <WS_ID> \
  --volume-ids <VOL_ID>
```

## Run a Service Job

```bash
# Ensure service is attached to the workspace first
$CLI services add-to-workspace \
  --workspace-id <WS_ID> \
  --service-ids <SERVICE_ID>

# Submit job with payload
$CLI service-jobs create \
  --workspace-id <WS_ID> \
  --service-id <SERVICE_ID> \
  --name "My Job" \
  --payload '{"tool": "tool_name", "inputs": {"param1": "value1"}}'

# Check job status
$CLI service-jobs get --workspace-id <WS_ID> --format table
```

**Payload format:** `{"tool": "<tool_name>", "inputs": {<parameters>}}` — always include `"inputs"` even if empty.

## Service Development Lifecycle (on a server)

Services are developed **on servers** inside the IDE:

1. **Scaffold** — Use templates from `~/.renderedai/templates` or ask the agent
2. **Configure** — Edit `service.yaml` (name, description, tools, inputs, outputs)
3. **Implement** — Write tool handlers, `entrypoint.py`, Dockerfile
4. **Build** — `docker build -t my-service -f .devcontainer/Dockerfile .`
5. **Test locally** — `docker run -e payload='{"tool":"...","inputs":{...}}' -v /workspace:/workspace -u $(id -u):$(id -g) my-service`
6. **Deploy** — Via agent deploy tool or `anadeploy` CLI

GPU support: add `--gpus all` to docker run. Mount source code for rapid iteration without full rebuilds.

## servers — Server management

**Important:** The CLI uses `--editor-id` (not `--server-id`) due to legacy naming. The UI calls these "servers" but the API still uses "editor" terminology.

| Command | Required Options | Optional |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| `servers get` | — | `--fields` |
| `servers create` | `--name` | `--workspace-id`, `--instance`, `--storage-size` (`small`=300GB, `medium`=500GB, `large`=1TB) |
| `servers delete` | `--editor-id` | — |
| `servers start` | `--editor-id` | — |
| `servers stop` | `--editor-id` | — |

**Server states:**
- **Running** — active, billable for compute
- **Stopped** — inactive, retains data, storage costs persist
- **Transitioning** — starting or shutting down

**Access methods:**
- **Browser** — `https://<editorId>.tyrell-proxy.prod.rendered.ai/#/workspace`
- **VS Code** — Remote SSH extension (requires SSH keys in Profile settings)
- **Cursor** — Remote SSH (requires SSH keys in Profile settings)
- **Windsurf** — Remote SSH (requires SSH keys in Profile settings)

**Instance types:**
- General Purpose (e.g., t3.xlarge, t3.2xlarge) — standard dev, lightweight tasks
- GPU Accelerated (e.g., g6.xlarge) — ML, rendering, GPU workloads

Use `$CLI services instance-types` to list available options with pricing.

**Scope behavior:**
- Organization-level: shared across all workspaces, **disabled by default** per workspace (must be explicitly enabled)
- User-level: personal configs, enabled by default
- Workspace-level: scoped to one workspace, enabled by default
- Workspace overrides let you enable/disable inherited configs without modifying originals
